# Specularity-Removal
This algorithm mainly works for **specularity removal**, adapted from https://github.com/muratkrty/specularity-removal.

You can see specific implementation of this algorithm in `specularity.py`. 
You can use `processing.py` to process your own images and use `video.py` for your own videos.

I am still working on this algorithm to imporove its generalizability.
You are expected to see many updates in these months!
